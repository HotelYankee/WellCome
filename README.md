# WellCome - A Mental Health Application (15 Project 2: Interactive Full-Stack Application)

### The Wellcome App is designed to help users who suffer from a wide range of mental health issues, particularly anxiety and depression. The app asks about the user's current mood after the user logs in and displays positive and uplifting affirmations to help them get through the day-to-day with ease. Wellcome has several options for users - they can journal, enjoy a yoga workout, meditate, and listen to relaxing music.
